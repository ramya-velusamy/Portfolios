## 1. Creation of Virtual Machine
This project demonstrates the creation of a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure. The VM is configured with specific parameters such as size, OS, and networking settings. It is a critical step for deploying applications and managing services in a cloud environment.

## Steps:
Create a new resource group.
Navigate to the "Virtual Machines" section in Azure.
Set up a VM with the desired OS and configurations.
Configure networking and storage options.
Deploy the VM and verify its status.
## 2. Deploying Git Repository in VM
In this module, a Git repository is deployed within the Azure VM. This allows the repository to be managed directly from the VM, providing flexibility for development and testing.

## Steps:
Access the VM via SSH or RDP.
Install Git on the VM.
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Set up the necessary environment and dependencies.
Run and test the application within the VM.
## 3. Creation of Storage Account (Blob Creation)
This project involves creating an Azure Storage Account and using Blob storage for managing large amounts of unstructured data. Blob storage is ideal for storing files, images, videos, and backups.

## Steps:
Create a Storage Account in Azure.
Navigate to the "Blob service" section.
Create a container within the Blob service.
Upload files or data to the Blob container.
Configure access permissions and settings.
## 4. Creation of Static Web Apps to Deploy Git Repository
This module demonstrates the deployment of a Git repository using Azure Static Web Apps. This service provides a simple and cost-effective way to host static websites with integrated CI/CD from GitHub.

## Steps:
Create a new Static Web App in Azure.
Connect the GitHub repository to the Static Web App.
Configure build and deployment settings.
Deploy the web app and monitor its status.
Access the deployed application through the provided URL.
## Conclusion
This portfolio highlights practical applications of Microsoft Azure's cloud services. Each module is designed to give hands-on experience with the essential tools and processes needed to deploy, manage, and scale applications in the cloud.
